Inter Process Communication (IPC) is the communication between two processes.
There are two types of communications -
  1. Communication between two related processes - parent-child processes
  2. Communication between two unrelated processes

Pipes - Communication between two related processes. It is half duplex mechanism i.e. first process can communicate with the second process. 
        To achieve full duplex another pipe is to be created so that second process can communicate with the first process.
        
FIFO - Communication between two unrealted processes. It is full deplex mechanism.

Message Queue - It is full duplex mechanism achieved by posting messages in the queue by one process and
                retireving the messages from another process from the queue. Once the message is retrieved it is deleted from the queue.
                
Shared memory - Communication between two or more processes is done using a shared memory which is to be protected byt he processes by synchronization.

Semaphores - These are used for synchronization. When one process accesses the memory it needs to be locked and released when the access is removed.

Signals âˆ’ Signal is a mechanism to communication between multiple processes by way of signaling. 
          This means a source process will send a signal (recognized by number) and the destination process will handle it accordingly.
